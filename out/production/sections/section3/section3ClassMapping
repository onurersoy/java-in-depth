> This text file contains the mapping of class instances of section 3.

===============================================================================================

part1.classes.methodBasics.objects ::

Product1 :  Creating a class, method and object
            System.out.println
            Literal & expression; declaration statements
            Using underscore on the declaration phase in a Long type numeric variable

Product2 :  Getting a default value if we declare a variable on class body
            Getting an error while trying to get the default value if we declare a variable in a method
            Declaring literal & expression statements on a method

Product3 :  Using assignment statements (successful and errored examples)
            Getting an error because of assigning a variable with a different type of value

Product4 :  Multi-variable declaration statements (declaring two variables in the same row)
            Re-assigning a variable

Product5 :  Type casting (assigning variable or literal of one type to variable of another type)
            Implicit casting (widening conversion)
            Explicit casting (narrowing conversion)
            Information loss in explicit casting (1.Truncation)

Product6 :  Object instance

part2.arrays ::

Student1 :  Creating an array

Student2 :  Creating an array (with 2nd and 3rd type of array creation notation)

Student3 :  Creating an array (with 4th type of array creation notation)
            Finding the number of elements inside an array

Student4 :  An object that an array of a class

CurrencyConverter :  Assignment#2

myArray :  2D Arrays
           Different type of array notations
           Length in arrays

myArray3D :  3D Arrays

===============================================================================================

CurrencyConverter2 :  Assignment#2.refactoring1
                      Using "new" in an assignment statement to manipulate the state of the same object reference by using an instance method
                      Method examples

methodIntro4 :  "How Data Is Passed To Methods In Java"

MoneyTransferService :  Assignment#3 (using class 'CurrencyConverter' from 'part2.arrays'

Person5 :  Using a constructor with a method and refactoring part

Person6 :  Removing the method by putting its business logic into the constructor (check "Person5")

Person7 :  Overloading constructors

Person8 :  Using 'this' for overloading constructors

Person 9 :  An alternative way of doing 'Person8'

Person 10 :  Usage of 'this' reference
            Refactoring 'Person8' by using 'this' reference

Object :  Reinitializing Object References
         Practice

Instructor :  Coding Exercise 1(Section 3.54) - Arrays with Object References
